Bullet points you need to remember
For easy fast marks in the assessment exams make sure you know and have written down:



The 5 Scrum Values
Commitment
Courage
Focus
Openness
Respect



The three pillars of Empiricism
Transparency

Adaption



Sprint Planning has 3 topics:

Topic One: Why is this Sprint valuable?
Topic Two: What can be Done this Sprint?
Topic Three: How will the chosen work get done?
You may hear about 3 questions to be asked at Daily Scrums "what did I do yesterday, what will I do today, do I have any blockers" although these are good questions to answer, they are not part of Scrum. So don't get confused. If you are asked "Which Sprint Event requires 3 questions to be considered" the answer is the Sprint Planning Event.
